# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project repository! This machine learning model is designed to predict whether a person would survive or not based on various features using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The project involves data cleaning, computation using NumPy, visualization with Matplotlib, preprocessing, and model building using SKLearn. The selected model for prediction is logistic regression, fine-tuned through GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## Model Overview

### Data Cleaning and Computation

- **Kaggle Titanic Dataset:**
  - The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
  - Employed pandas for data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.

- **NumPy Computations:**
  - Utilized NumPy for numerical computations and manipulations on the dataset.

### Data Visualization

- **Matplotlib Visualization:**
  - Employed Matplotlib for visualizing data distributions, correlations, and insights.
  - Visualized survival rates, age distributions, and other relevant features.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Engaged in feature engineering to create meaningful features from the available data.
  - Processed categorical variables and handled missing values.

### Model Building

- **SKLearn Logistic Regression:**
  - Chose logistic regression as the predictive model for binary classification (survived or not).
  - Fine-tuned the model using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.

### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy Metrics:**
  - Model performance evaluated using accuracy metrics to measure its effectiveness in predicting survival outcomes.

## Project Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Make Predictions:**
   - Input passenger information to make predictions about their survival on the Titanic.

## Note

This Titanic Survival Prediction model demonstrates the application of logistic regression for binary classification based on the Kaggle Titanic dataset. The model is fine-tuned for optimal performance, providing insights into survival predictions.
